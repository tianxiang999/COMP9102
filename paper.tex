% This is sigproc-sp.tex -FILE FOR V2.6SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% OCTOBER 2002
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V2.6SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.6SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
%
%  However, both the CopyrightYear (default to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (default to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX) can still be over-ridden by whatever the author
% inserts into the source .tex file.
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2003 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@acm.org

% For tracking purposes - this is V2.6SP - OCTOBER 2002

\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms to
the formatting guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings.
It complements the document \textit{Author's Guide to Preparing
ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and Bib\TeX}. This
source file has been written with the intention of being
compiled under \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX.

The developers have tried to include every imaginable sort
of ``bells and whistles", such as a subtitle, footnotes on
title, subtitle and authors, as well as in the text, and
every optional component (e.g. Acknowledgments, Additional
Authors, Appendices), not to mention examples of
equations, theorems, tables and figures.

To make best use of this sample document, run it through \LaTeX\
and BibTeX, and compare this source code with the printed
output produced by the dvi file.
